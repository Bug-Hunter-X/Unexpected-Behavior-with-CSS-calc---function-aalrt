To fix these issues, ensure there are no spaces immediately before or after the operators within the `calc()` expression, and make sure all units are consistent. For instance, use only pixels or percentages, or convert units if necessary for compatibility.  Here's how to correct the examples:

Incorrect (spaces around operator):
`width: calc( 100% - 20px );`

Correct:
`width: calc(100% - 20px);`

Incorrect (inconsistent units):
`height: calc(50% + 10px);` (Ambiguous without context, but conversion may be needed)

Possible Correction (If height should be 50% plus 10 pixels of the parent):
`height: calc(50% + 10px);`

Alternatively, if you have a fixed pixel height that should be 50% of something else:
`height: calc((some_element_height / 2) + 10px);`
(You would need to replace `some_element_height` with the actual height value or selector.)

Always double-check your unit consistency to avoid unexpected results.
