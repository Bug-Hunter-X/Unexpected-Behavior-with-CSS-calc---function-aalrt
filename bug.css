The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if there are spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /), it might lead to unexpected results. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works correctly, while `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` might not.  Another issue can arise if the units are inconsistent within a `calc()` expression (e.g., mixing pixels and percentages without proper unit conversion).
